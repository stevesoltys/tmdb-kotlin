# How to contribute
Thank üôè you for your interest in contributing to this project! Please read this document to get started.

The following steps will give a short guide on how to contribute to this project:

- Create a personal [fork](https://github.com/ChrisKruegerDev/tmdb-kotlin/fork) of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/) is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Start from `main`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code, and add some examples.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Run all tests - if available.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed. Please follow the [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `main` branch!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
  your extra branch(es).
